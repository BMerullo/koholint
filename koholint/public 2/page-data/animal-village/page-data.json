It is located in the southeastern corner of Koholint Island.\n\nThe inhabitants consist of Rabbits, Christine, Chef Bear, Schule Donavitch, the Hippo Model, and a Zora. All the Animals seem to be enamored with the singing voice of Marin, who goes with Link to sing the Ballad of the Wind Fish to the inhabitants. When Marin is not there, the Animals constantly remind Link that Marin must come back someday to sing them another Song.\n\nOne of the Rabbits mentions that the Animal Village is a sister city to Mabe Village.[3] Its inhabitants are unable to go visit Mabe Village because of the uprising in monster sightings and attacks that spanned the area connecting the two Villages together.[4]"},"id":"38584119-da07-5227-9f90-335e3b6a3b52","image":{"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/v2m63u1ogzpz/15SMXmhkfjxnVASziNwWCm/a9eea1987183770c8e213df0ba991cae/animal-village.webp?w=320&h=180&q=50&fm=webp 320w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/v2m63u1ogzpz/15SMXmhkfjxnVASziNwWCm/a9eea1987183770c8e213df0ba991cae/animal-village.webp?w=640&h=360&q=50&fm=webp 640w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/v2m63u1ogzpz/15SMXmhkfjxnVASziNwWCm/a9eea1987183770c8e213df0ba991cae/animal-village.webp?w=1280&h=720&q=50&fm=webp 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1280,"height":720,"placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpQAAABXRUJQVlA4IIgAAAAwBACdASoUAAsAPuleqE0pJSOiMAgBIB0JbACdMoRwACT8wCKUW9W3+AAA/STmMj5+IWBaBkh1oQqy0QcGNN0d8k9Jab8PWvcoX/NAnzzy8/he5NGpbdNnXZIBMFSD0Kb8bH429C6VnuQ9Z8N4K++khrQ+6EtoHhtnkWiAGmYiQkJ2/6vPuAAA"}}},"info":{"locations":["koholint island"],"catagories":["locations"]},"locationBoolean":true}},"pageContext":{"id":"38584119-da07-5227-9f90-335e3b6a3b52","name":"animal village","__params":{"name":"animal-village"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3116540486"]}

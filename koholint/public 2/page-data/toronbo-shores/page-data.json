After a local girl named Marin nursed him back to health, north in Mabe Village, and her father Tarin gave him his shield, Link journeyed down and talked with a mysterious Owl about the Wind Fish, he found his sword in the wreckage. He then turned northward to the Mysterious Woods the locale where the owl advised him to journey next. He later journeyed here to talk with Marin about removing a walrus from the entrance to Yarna Desert. This beach borders the region called South of the Village to the north and the Martha's Bay region to the east.\n\nToronbo Shores is a beautiful beach with tall palm trees for shade in the sun. The beach extends far and gives lots of space for relaxation. Marin has been known to constantly look out towards the ocean, wandering what is outside of the island. However, when Link arrived washed up on shore, he drew monsters toward him knowing that he could wake the Wind Fish. Toronbo Shores contains Sale's House o' Bananas as well as a cave on its southern portion that can be accessed after acquiring the Magnifying Lens."},"id":"31537991-abe1-571a-94fb-84b0bd158a12","image":{"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/v2m63u1ogzpz/3l022ambvp3cB376LEkR5x/a13815d07cfda79a3c42266b91552993/toronbo-shores.jpeg?w=320&h=180&q=50&fm=webp 320w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/v2m63u1ogzpz/3l022ambvp3cB376LEkR5x/a13815d07cfda79a3c42266b91552993/toronbo-shores.jpeg?w=640&h=360&q=50&fm=webp 640w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/v2m63u1ogzpz/3l022ambvp3cB376LEkR5x/a13815d07cfda79a3c42266b91552993/toronbo-shores.jpeg?w=1280&h=720&q=50&fm=webp 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/v2m63u1ogzpz/3l022ambvp3cB376LEkR5x/a13815d07cfda79a3c42266b91552993/toronbo-shores.jpeg?w=1280&h=720&fl=progressive&q=50&fm=jpg","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/v2m63u1ogzpz/3l022ambvp3cB376LEkR5x/a13815d07cfda79a3c42266b91552993/toronbo-shores.jpeg?w=320&h=180&fl=progressive&q=50&fm=jpg 320w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/v2m63u1ogzpz/3l022ambvp3cB376LEkR5x/a13815d07cfda79a3c42266b91552993/toronbo-shores.jpeg?w=640&h=360&fl=progressive&q=50&fm=jpg 640w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/v2m63u1ogzpz/3l022ambvp3cB376LEkR5x/a13815d07cfda79a3c42266b91552993/toronbo-shores.jpeg?w=1280&h=720&fl=progressive&q=50&fm=jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1280,"height":720,"placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"}}},"info":{"locations":["koholint island"],"catagories":["locations"]},"locationBoolean":true}},"pageContext":{"id":"31537991-abe1-571a-94fb-84b0bd158a12","name":"toronbo-shores","__params":{"name":"toronbo-shores"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3116540486"]}
